/*
Practice Question 1: Filtering Fruits
Given the following list of fruits:
final fruits = {
  'apple': 40,
  'banana': 25,
  'cherry': 15,
  'date': 50,
  'elderberry': 30
};
Use Dartâ€™s higher-order functions to 
calculate the total number of fruits 
that have names longer than 5 characters. 
How many apples, bananas, and elderberries are there in total?
